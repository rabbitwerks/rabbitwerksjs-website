          My initial encounter with anything web design was Yahoo! Geo-Cities. They offered a free website builder. Must have, cause i was only in 6th grade. It didnt amount to much overall, but it was fun to play around and see what I could make on the screen. After which, my next run-in was in age of Myspace, and being in a punk-rock band in high school, we needed an awesome myspace design to accompany are rough and ragged sound.
          <br><br>
          Alongside myspace, I was taking photographics and screen printing classes throughout high-school, and found by doing so, that I enjoyed graphic design. The next step as obvious to me at that point... continue my journey into graphic design. So thats what I did. I enrolled in college and into a graphic design program. It went well, and during that time I got to play around with web design a bit. Which was fun, to a certain point, but I was more so focused on graphics that it didnt make much of an impression 
          on me. At this point, it was HTML4 and something called "XHTML" was the hot ticket item.
          <br><br>
          Sadly, I never got to experience the wonder of Javascript at this point. That would have been way over our heads, anyway. As well as discovering that graphic design wasn't what I thought it would be.. Bad client expereiences, and a stolen laptop with all my college work and software. GONE. I never quite really bounced back from that as far as graphic design, and ended up needing to just find work at this point, graphic design, and anything web got put on the back burner for the long haul....

            Hey everyone, and welcome to Rabbit Thoughts, otherwise known as my Javascript blog. Let me just take the time to say that if you're reading this, THANK YOU! YOU ARE AWESOME!! Now then, onwards and forwards. In this blog I will be talking about the various Werks and projects I have in motion. As well as any and all things I may come across on my adventures through Javascript.
            <br><br>
            So... What the heck is RabbitWerks? Good Question.. 
            RabbitWerks is best described as an not-entirely-defined entity. RabbitWerks is as much of a concept as it is a name. It refers to the motion of ideas. How they are always ever-changing in some ways, and yet are fixed in other ways. One idea leads to another, which leads to another, in-turn creating a cycle. A loop. A never-ending hole.... The concept that there is no start point, and no end-point for an idea. A continuous cycle of werks and ideas.
            <br><br>
            My name is Sean Becker. This is my Story. RabbitWerks is my brainchild. Javascript is my playground. 
            <br>
            More to come soon....

<!--My name is Sean Becker, and I have been finding nothing but inspiration and great pinpoint accurate content for where I’m at right now in life, on your channel.
Behind the Scenes, bod jobs, and losing motivation videos have all inspired me to take a leap of faith and keep following my passion. Never give up, right!?

I have been discovering and learning Javascript for the better part of a year now and I am finding that I love it more each day! Its quite amazing really. I was working as a brickmason for a while just working my body into dust. When on the off season, winter time, the point came where I needed a website. Well long story short. I had some training in college on web design years ago. So HTML5 and CSS3 alone blew me out of the water when I started to rediscover web design. One of the most, if not THE MOST important discoveries at that point was of Javascript.

Javascript. Its pretty amazing to me. Amazing enough to quit that brickmason job and immerse myself in everything JS development and programming in general. I have been doing freelance web design to pay the bills, but Javascript is where my passion lies…
